# WATOPOLY
Watopoly is a two to five player, pass-and-play, board game. Players will take turns traveling around a University of Waterloo campus-themed game board, attempting to buy, trade, and develop as many campus buildings as possible. Money can be used to buy and develop properties or obtained/lost through chance cards, tax squares, and rent. The objective is to avoid forfeiting and to drive your opponents to bankruptcy using your properties. Have fun warriors!
